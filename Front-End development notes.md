When you search on the internet:
* Request URL search goes to the internet provider.
* Internet provider sends the request to the DNS to look-up the IP address of the request URL.
* DNS returns the IP address of the server for the site you want.
* IP is sent through your internet provider, through the internet backbone to the server.
* Data is returned through the same, but opposite route.

When you use a website:
* HTML files are responsible for the structure of a website.
* CSS files are responsible for the style of a website.
* JS files are responsible for function and behaviour of the website.
